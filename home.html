<h3 style ='position:fixed; top:160px; left:20px; text-align:center'>Values of Modelling</h3>
<div id ='rightbar' class ='scrollable'>
<p>
 <b> <I>Fashion show and Modelling is not primarily about the Crown; about the person who wins and about those who do not win. 

- It is about the social or societal value of the shows.</I></B></p> 
 
<H5>Below are Values expressed by Modelling</h6>
<ul>
<li>entertainment, for people to watch nice things and be happy among group other group of persons. </li>

<li>advertisement, to give the designers the opportunities to promote their works of art. This is why we need Fashion Designers who know the worth and would value the Business/Entertainment</li>

<li>charity/public good. each Fashion & Modelling Show should have a reason and motivation behind it. What will the organisers do for the common masses? What do that want to promote? What would the emerging winners or competitors (if any), do for the soceity? What are their motivations and ambitions in life? </li>
</ul>
<p>
For us in MfC-Africa, while we hope to achieve these and other good objectives that may be related to them, we will use every opportunity we have to win souls for Christ.</p>

<p>Values & Virtues expected in a Model for Christ.

(Please teach these things). 

1. We have to love and value strangers; have open minds towards people you have not met before; respond to them, because you will work with many without even meeting them.
<br>
2. Value life of every living thing, including the unborn child. Be Pro-Life. Do not support Abortion whether publicly or privately.
